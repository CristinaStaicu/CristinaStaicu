My interests to investigate the Bio-MagMEMS properties and medical image processing applied to human anatomy were fueled by my undergraduate studies of [Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://acs.pub.ro/ ) and [Biophysics](http://fizica.unibuc.ro/Fizica/Main.php) in Romania, continued with my MEng studies of [Biomaterial Science and Tissue Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/materials/research/themes/biomaterials-and-tissue-engineering) at the University of Sheffield in UK with the 60 000 euros UNDP- Romanian Government Special [Scholarship](https://www.mae.ro/node/2115 ). I then specialised in patient-specific cardiovascular diagnostic techniques using image processing through my PhD study at The University of Sheffield in [euHeart](http://www.euheart.eu/ ) , the biggest European research project funded by the European Commission.
